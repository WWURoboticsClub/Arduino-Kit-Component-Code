# Arduino-Kit-Component-Code
Here you can find the bare bone code for the components in our kits. Each file listed will be the code for a different component.

Ultrasonic Sensor:
The ultrasonic sensor that came with the kit is a HC-SR04 model sensor, and the code for this sensor is under the model number.

Motor Shield:
Note that I did not include values for the Arduino pins in the motor shield code because this can change depending on individual robot setup. 
Also, you don't need PWM pins for the motors as the analogWrite takes care of that. The pins you connect with the motor shield are the digital pins, not analog pins.
The motor shield model number is L298N - Dual H-Bridge
